Description: DebarcodeR is an R package for demultiplexing fluorescent cell 
    barcoded (FCB) barcoded flow cytometery data. Fluorescent cell barcoding is
    a technique for implementing pooled sample multiplexing in fluorescence flow
    cytometry using amine reactive dyes to label each sample with unique barcodes
    by varying the concentration of one or more dyes. Sample can the be pooled,
    stained, and acquired in a single tube, which reduces instrument time and
    reagent consumption and improves data robustness. Following acquisition,
    the data must be 'debarcoded' (also known as deconvolution or demultiplexing)
    which traditionally has required manual biaxial gating. DebarcodeR implements
    an algorithm for automating this demultiplexing process which improves
    reproducibility and enables high throughput data processing.
